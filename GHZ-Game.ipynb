One gets puzzled only if one tries to understand how the rules can work not only for the actual situation in which they are applied, but also in alternative situations that might have been chosen but were not. (...) A good motto for the quantum physicist and for future quantum computer scientists might be 'What didn’t happen didn't happen.'\""
